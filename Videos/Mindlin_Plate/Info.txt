All this simulations feature a DAE system. By projection this is turned into an ODE

Small descrtiption of each video:

- Interconnected_MindlinPlates
	Two unit (L=1) square plates interconnected at L/3 and 2*L/3. Excited by
   		f_plate1 = A*y (t<0.2*t_end)
    	f_plate2 = A*(L - y ) (t<0.2*t_end)  
  
  
- Mindlin_SymmetricExcitation
  	Unit cantilver square Mindlin plate with inhomogenous Neumann condtion
    	q_n (y = 0) = +f(y, t)
    	q_n (y = L) = -f(y, t)
  
    	with f(y,t) = sin(pi/L*y) (t<0.25*t_end) 
  
  
- Mindlin_Gravity
  	Unit square plate with bc CFCF subject to gravity field
