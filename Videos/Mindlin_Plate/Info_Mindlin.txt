All this simulations feature a DAE system. By projection this is turned into an ODE.
Physical parameters: unit square thick (t/L = 0.1) aluminium plate


Small descrtiption of each video:

- Interconnected_MindlinPlates
	Two unit (L=1) square plates interconnected at L/3 and 2*L/3. Excited by
   		f_plate1 = 1000*y		(t<0.2*t_end)
    		f_plate2 = 1000*(L - y )  	(t<0.2*t_end)  
  
  
- Mindlin_SymmetricExcitation
  	Unit cantilver square Mindlin plate with inhomogenous Neumann condtion
    	q_n (y = 0) = +f(x, t)
    	q_n (y = L) = -f(x, t)
  
    	with f(y,t) = (10^5)*sin(pi/L*x) (t<0.25*t_end) 
  
  
- Mindlin_Gravity
  	Unit square plate with bc CFCF subject to gravity field
