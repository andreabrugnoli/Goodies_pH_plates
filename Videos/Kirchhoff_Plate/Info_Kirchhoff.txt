This folder contains some simulations of the Kirchhoff plate written as a port-Hamiltonian system.

All this simulations feature a DAE system. By projection this is turned into an ODE.
Physical parameters:  unit square thin (t/L = 0.05) aluminium plate
A = 10^5
Small descrtiption of each video:
 
- Kirchhoff_Damped
	Boundary damping injection for a cantilever plate
		For 0<t<1s no control action
		Plate damped in 4 seconds
  
- Kirchh_SymmetricExcitation
  	Cantilever Kirchoff plate with inhomogenous Neumann condtion
    	q_n (y = 0) = f(x, t)
    	q_n (y = L) = f(x, t)
		q_n (x = L) = f(x = L, t)
  
    	with f(y,t) = A*x (t<0.25*t_end) 
  
  
- Kirchh_Gravity
	Unit square plate with bcs CCCF subject to gravity field
	
- Kirchh_Rod 
	Cantilever plate undergoing a distributed force welded to a rigid rod. 
		f_d = A*(y + 10(y-L/2)^*2)
	
	By comparison the same simulation without the rod is considered (Kirchhff_NoRod)
